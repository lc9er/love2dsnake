Overview:

1. Snake is represented by a sequence of X and Y positions.
    a. Starts out as 4 segments.
2. When the snake moves, the last item (tail position) is removed, and an item is added to the front
(new head position) in the direction the snake is going.
3. If the new head position is at the same position as the food;s position, then the snake's tail is
not removed, and the food is moved to a random position not occupied by the snake.
4. If the new head position is at the same position as any of the snake's other segments, then the
game is over.
